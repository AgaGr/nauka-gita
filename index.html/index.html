            <p>The second someone mentioned you were all alone</p>
            <p>I could feel the trouble coursing through your veins</p>
            <p>Now I know, it's got a hold</p>
            <p>Just a phone called left unanswered, had me sparking up</p>
            <p>These cigarettes won't stop me wondering where you are</p>
            <p>Don't let go, keep a hold</p>
            <p>If you look into the distance, there's a house upon the hill</p>
            <p>Guiding like a lighthouse to a place where you'll be</p>
            <p>Safe to feel at grace 'cause we've all made mistakes</p>
            <p>If you've lost your way</p>
            <p>I will leave the light on</p>
            <p>I will leave the light on</p>
            <p>I will leave the light on</p>
            <p>I will leave the light on</p>
